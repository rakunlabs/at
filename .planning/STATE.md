# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Tasks submitted to an organization are intelligently routed through the agent hierarchy via LLM-driven delegation, with full task tracking at every level.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from requirement dependencies — Foundation → Core Delegation → Depth & Concurrency → UI
- [Roadmap]: UI deferred to Phase 4; backend proven before UI investment
- [Research]: Org Task Router is a service-layer function, NOT a workflow node — separate code path from agent_call

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Delegation tool interception mechanism has 3 candidate approaches — needs spike in Phase 2 planning
- [Research]: Prompt engineering for delegation quality needs empirical iteration with real LLMs
- [Research]: Server restart recovery for in-flight delegations not yet designed
